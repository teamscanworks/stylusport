# RFC-0003: CLI Architecture

Status: Draft  
Date: 2025-04-01  
Author: Scanworks Team  

This is an evolving document that will be updated as the project develops.

## Summary

This document specifies the CLI architecture for `StylusPort`, defining a modular, extensible command structure that grows with the pipeline. The design shall accommodate future pipeline stages through a command pattern and shared abstractions.

## Motivation

The `StylusPort` CLI shall:
1. Start with parser visualization for development and testing
2. Provide a complete translation workflow including each pipeline stage
3. Maintain testability and usability across this evolution

## Goals

The CLI architecture shall:
- Define a consistent command structure across pipeline stages
- Enable isolation of pipeline stages for testing and development
- Support multiple output formats for integration with other tools
- Create abstractions that prevent code duplication as commands are added
- Establish patterns for configuration, error handling, and output formatting

## Non-Goals

The CLI architecture shall not:
- Support interactive mode (batch processing only)
- Provide IDE integration (separate concern)
- Implement parallel processing of multiple files (future enhancement)

## Design

### Command Structure

The CLI shall follow a stage-based command structure:
```shell
stylusport <pipeline-stage> [stage-options] <input-path>
```

### Pipeline Stages

The CLI shall support the following pipeline stages:

| Command | Pipeline Stages | Output |
|---------|-----------------|--------|
| `parse` | Parse | AST |
| `normalize` | Parse → Normalize | Normalized Model |
| `build-ir` | Parse → Normalize → Build IR | IR |
| `explain` | Parse → Normalize → Build IR → Explain | Annotated IR |
| `generate` | Complete Pipeline | Stylus Code |
| `lint` | Parse → Normalize → Build IR → Lint | Diagnostics |

### Core Components

#### Command Modules

Each pipeline stage shall have a corresponding command module with:
- Command registration logic
- Command execution logic
- Stage-specific options

#### Output Formatting

The CLI shall support multiple output formats:
- YAML: Human-readable, diffable format
- JSON: Machine-readable format for tooling
- Debug: Raw Rust debug print of data structures

#### Configuration

A shared configuration system shall handle:
- Input/output path resolution
- Format selection
- Verbosity controls
- Stage-specific options

#### Error Handling

A unified error type shall represent failures from any pipeline stage with:
- Stage identification
- Detailed error messages
- Source context when available

### Verbosity Levels

The CLI shall support multiple verbosity levels:
- Quiet: Only errors
- Normal: Errors and results
- Verbose: Detailed information about transformations
- Debug: Internal state and transformation traces

### Development and Testing Workflow

The CLI design shall support:
1. Inspecting intermediate representations for debugging
2. Snapshot testing of outputs at each pipeline stage
3. Fixture-based testing with known inputs

## Future Work

### Watch Mode

The CLI may be enhanced in the future with a `--watch` flag to automatically reprocess inputs when source files change, which would be useful during development.

### Performance Considerations

For processing large projects, the CLI should:
- Stream outputs where possible
- Support pagination or truncation for very large outputs
- Consider incremental processing options

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Single command with --stage option**
   - Pro: Simplified command structure
   - Con: Less discoverable, harder to have stage-specific options

2. **Independent binaries per stage**
   - Pro: Complete isolation
   - Con: Harder to maintain consistency, increased binary size
